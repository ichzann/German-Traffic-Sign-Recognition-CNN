# German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-CNN
I'am learning how to build a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify german traffic signs. 
## About the project

I'll be using the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Data Set with CNN method 

# AI Implication
- creating a road map about how to learn and which steps to follow during the project.
- Since it's my very first project with a Neural Network, I heavily relied on AI during the whole process. I asked the AI to create a tutorial with similar step-by-step instructions, which I followed. Except for step-by-step instructions, I also got help from AI to understand some of the arguments or syntax where the documentations were not easy to understand (especially with the data splitting step).

# What I learned

- Through the project, I could gain my first experience with the image process before feeding the CNN, and working on the layers of the CNN was another important experience.

- I could learn about the arguments/methods, such as dropout, dense, flatten, and pooling.

- I could gain my first insight about the libraries cv2, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
