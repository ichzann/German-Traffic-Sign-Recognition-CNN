# German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-CNN
I'am learning how to build a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify german traffic signs. 
## About the project

I'll be using the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Data Set with CNN method 

# AI Implication
- creating a road map about how to learn and which steps to follow during the project.
